# Place whatever regex you want in this file, one per line
# Extended regex style will be used (like with grep -E), with some restrictions due to zipgrep.
# zipgrep does not support Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions (PCREs), so we need to avoid all of these:
# - \b (word boundaries)
# - Lookaheads/lookbehinds ((?=...), (?<=...), etc.)
# - Non-capturing groups ((?:...))
# - Lazy quantifiers (*?, +?, ??)
# - Complex backreferences (\1, \2, etc.)
# - Test POSIX bracket expressions ([:alnum:], [:digit:], etc.) for environment-specific issues
